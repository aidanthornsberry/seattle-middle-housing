10/14/2025,005472-25PA,Building & Land Use Pre-Application,Completed,1700  R  S  DONOVAN  ST   SEATTLE,26kV Donovan Duwamish River Crossing,"The local in-city electrical grid requires a connection between the westside (City of Seattle) and eastside (City of Tukwila) to meet energy demands, including forecasts for large increases in electricity usage, and a corresponding need for greater reliability of that electricity. Prior to 2003, an in-kind circuit provided connectivity via an overhead line, however attempts to reconstruct that line were stymied by a variety of factors. Electrification of fossil fuel power has already begun in the south Seattle area, and larger circuits with multiple paths of delivery, as provided by this circuit, are necessary to continue reducing fossil fuel use and to meet growing demands for clean energy. The project proposes installation of these circuits below the Duwamish River using trenchless methods, specifically (horizontal directional drilling [HDD]). This method avoids interference with other uses of the river (navigation, industry, habitat), and many potential environmental risks. The project will install three circuits beneath the Duwamish River between two Boeing owned properties (1) South Park property on the west and (2) Thompson/Isaacson property on the east. Practically and economically, the circuits must be installed beneath the river using trenchless construction techniques (HDD) because overhead placement of the circuits is not possible within the height restrictions imposed by the U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), and Federal Aviation Administration. Open-cut installation beneath the riverbed is not practical from a construction standpoint, and would be too environmentally disruptive, with a high degree of risk. The lines must also be greater than 10 feet below the authorized dredge depth (-15 feet MLLW or -17.33 NAVD 88) to accommodate USACE dredging of the waterway, and to meet safety and engineering requirements.  The crossing includes three circuits that will be placed in three 32-inch diameter HDPE or PVC casing pipes. Once the casings are in place, a conduit bundle consisting of six 6-inch PVC conduit and one 4-inch conduit will be sliplined inside the casing. The conduit bundles will terminate at the HDD pit at each end. Connections will be established from the HDD pits to the existing grid within adjacent road rights-of-way, utilizing either overhead or underground routes. All connections will be situated entirely in upland areas.",,,

In the report the geotech recommended we place retaining walls with geotech fabric to add to the stability of the slope. as noted below:  Any slope in Seattle that has an inclination of 40 percent or more and a height of 10 feet or more is considered a Steep Slope Erosion Hazard Area, per Seattle Municipal Code (SMC). A Steep Slope Erosion Hazard Area exists at the western portion of the subject site. SMC 25.09.090.8.1 states that development on Steep Slope Erosion Hazard Areas is prohibited unless ""relief"" can be obtained. Based on SMC 25.09.090.8.2.b, relief from the prohibition of development can be obtained for Steep Slope Erosion Hazard Areas when development is located on steep slope erosion hazard areas that were created by previous legal grading, if no adverse impact on the steep slope erosion hazard area will result.We believe that relief from development restrictions of the Steep Slope Erosion Hazard Area on the site. as noted in SMC 25.09.090.8.2.b. is warranted based on the following reasons:1. The portion of the site Steep Slope Erosion Hazard Area exceeding 10 feet in height includes a concrete retaining wall about 5 feet tall and slopes that have clearly been graded.2. The proposed engineered retaining walls will extend down to competent native soils and will completely stabilize the Steep Slope Erosion Hazard Area.In summary, it is our professional opinion from a geotechnical engineering standpoint that, provided recommendations in this study are followed, gaining relief from the Steep Slope Erosion Hazard Areas development standards of the SMC is appropriate for this project.Attached are all the supportive documents as well as a 2D design showing our rough proposed beckyard installation.",,,

Seattle Public Utilities (SPU) owns and operates a wastewater collection system serving the City of Seattle.  As part of its Pump Station Rehabilitation Program, SPU proposes to construct improvements at its below-grade wastewater Pump Station 58 (PS58) at 1350 N Northlake Wy in the Fremont neighborhood of the City of Seattle.  This project would make comprehensive civil, mechanical, structural, electrical, and stormwater drainage improvements to PS58 to improve worker safety and to extend the useful life of the facility.  The scope also includes modifications to improve maintenance access, update instrumentation, and bring the station into compliance with current codes to the maximum extent feasible.  A code-compliant wet well ventilation system would be installed along with a new odor control system.  Exhaust fans would be located above-grade in cabinets.  Work would also replace approximately 58 lineal feet of an existing 6-inch diameter force main with new 6-inch diameter pipe.  The remaining approximately 122 lineal feet of the existing force main is in serviceable condition and would not be replaced or repaired.   Site work at PS58 would be limited to pavement surface restoration to accommodate excavations for ventilation piping, electrical conduit, and work on the force main, as well as above-grade mechanical and cabinet equipment.  Shallow excavations up to 4 feet are expected adjacent to the structure for ventilation, electrical, and force main replacement.  SPU plans to construct this project in 2026 or 2027. The entire project location is in the Urban Maritime Environment of the City of Seattle’s Shoreline Management District.  The Project is exempt from obtaining the Shoreline Substantial Development Permit at Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) 23.60A.020.C.1 as normal maintenance or repair of existing structures.",,,
